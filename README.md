AI Multi-Repository Code Analysis Tool
An enterprise-grade tool that combines static code analysis, semantic search, and natural language querying to provide comprehensive insights into complex, multi-repository software architectures.
What This Tool Does
Transform how development teams understand and analyze codebases across multiple repositories. The tool automatically discovers relationships between services, identifies security vulnerabilities, and enables natural language queries about your entire codebase.
Key Capabilities:

Natural language queries: "Show me all authentication functions" or "Find API endpoints that handle user data"
Cross-repository dependency mapping and visualization
Automated security vulnerability detection
Performance bottleneck identification
Interactive architecture diagrams
Multi-language support: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript

Business Value
