# AI Multi-Repository Code Analysis Tool

> Enterprise-grade code analysis with static + semantic search + natural language queries

---

##  What It Does

A powerful tool for analyzing complex, multi-repository codebases:
-  Automatically detects functions, classes, dependencies, and API endpoints
-  Analyzes cross-repository interactions
-  Flags security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks
-  Enables natural language queries (e.g., "Show all login endpoints")
-  Supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript
