AI Multi-Repository Code Analysis Tool
An enterprise-grade tool that combines static code analysis, semantic search, and natural language querying to provide comprehensive insights into complex, multi-repository software architectures.
What This Tool Does
Transform how development teams understand and analyze codebases across multiple repositories. The tool automatically discovers relationships between services, identifies security vulnerabilities, and enables natural language queries about your entire codebase.
Key Capabilities:

Natural language queries: "Show me all authentication functions" or "Find API endpoints that handle user data"
Cross-repository dependency mapping and visualization
Automated security vulnerability detection
Performance bottleneck identification
Interactive architecture diagrams
Multi-language support: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript

Business Value
Quantified Impact for a 100-developer team:

Developer onboarding: Reduce from 4 weeks to 2 weeks (save $375,000 annually)
Code review efficiency: Cut review time from 3 hours to 1.5 hours (save $292,500 annually)
Security analysis: Automate manual reviews (save $150,000 annually)
Architecture documentation: Generate automatically (save $90,000 annually)

Total Annual Value: $907,500
Tool Cost: $75,000 annually
ROI: 1,110%
How It Works
The tool analyzes your repositories using advanced AST parsing and machine learning to:

Extract Code Relationships: Functions, classes, API calls, and dependencies
Build Knowledge Graph: Create semantic connections between code elements
Enable Natural Queries: Answer questions about your codebase in plain English
Generate Insights: Identify security issues, performance problems, and architecture patterns
